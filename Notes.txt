React Context explained
What: Let's you create context that can given to other components


Why: For sending data from one place to another like a props but larger than
props like a zustan but small than it 
Create a context(some data) that you want that other(all) 
component read or provide (Yeah it's like zustand but it uses for lil on small scale)

React.createContext: is a hook in which we context object(basically data)
const MyContext = React.createContext("Hello);


Hello is default value when there is 
if you don't have default value then use "null"

createContext returns a context object that has two values 
1. provider: for sharing the value
2. Consumer: for using the value


Provider: has param called value
Value: is that value that you want to pass

1. Create the Context 
2. Provide the Value
3. Wrap the context with the app
3. Consume the Value
